## Overview

The core mechanic of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is Terastallization, a phenomenon that changes the type and appearance of the Pokémon into a crystalline figure. This repository contains a shader (and other assets) for recreating the basic look and feel of the effect in Unity Shader Graph. Also included is a plugin that converts mesh UVs into a greyscale texture with random colors assigned to each triangle of the mesh.
